        Yo, Ghost here. Been a minute since I posted on a public net, but I gotta get this off my chrome-addled mind. 
        You all seen the whispers, yeah? The glitches, the twitching, the sudden brain-fried chooms yelling about seeing god or some gonk shit before their wetware just fries. 
        That's my life now, or what's left of it anyway.
        <br />

        It all started with Deacon. You know Deacon. 
        Chrome-obsessed, more machine than man, always pushing the limits. He got this idea, see? 
        This "cold-fusion power conduit" he snagged, said it was the key to true perfection, a way to make us Maelstrom tougher, faster, more... us. 
        He started hooking chooms up, promising implants that'd make us gods. He called 'em "perfect subjects."
        <br />
        <br />

        At first, it was preem. Boosts like nothing I ever felt. 
        But then... the flickering started. My optics, my arm cyberware, even my brain-to-synth interface. 
        Justâ€¦ flicker. Like a bad flatline recording. And then the whispers, not from my comms, but in my head. 
        Like static, but always there, scratching at the edges of my sanity.
        <br />

        Deacon, that chrome-hearted bastard, he just watches. He says it's part of the "evolution," the "purging of the weak." 
        He's gone full chrome himself, pure cyberpsycho, rambling about "perfecting" humanity. But I see the others he's worked on. 
        They don't evolve, choom. They break. Their eyes go dead, their movements jerky, and then... the screams. The full-blown cyberpsychosis.
        <br />
        <br />

        I'm next, ain't I? I feel it. The cold dread creeping in, the fear that my own chrome, the very thing that makes me Maelstrom, is gonna be my end.
        I'm trying to find a ripperdoc, anyone who can cut this bad juju out, but who wants to touch Maelstrom tech, especially Deacon's?
        <br />

        Just wanted to put this out there. 
        If you see me out on the street, twitching, eyes wild, just know... it ain't me no more. 
        It's the glitch. And Deacon's making more of us every damn day.

        Stay sharp, chooms. And watch your chrome.
        <br />
